    "# Non-Ideal Gas Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand why most gases dont behave ideally.\n",
    "2. Use equations of the state for non-ideal gases.\n",
    "3. Use the compressability factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before this class you most likely have used the **ideal gas law**, $ P V = n R T $, but this equation of state is not very accurate in describing gases in the real world. This is because the **ideal gas law** assumes that gas particiles are infinitisemal points of mass and that these points of mass do not interact with each other. This is a major flaw in the ideal gas law and causes the ideal gas law to be close to the true when pressures are very low  and if the gases were noble gases, esspacially Helium.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why equations of state for **non-ideal gases** are crucial for calculating how **real gases**. In this section we will focus on the **compressiblility factors** to correct the ideal gas law and the **viral equation**, the **Van der Walls equation**, and the **Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations of the State for Non-Ideal Gases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical temperature**, $T_c$ and **critical pressure**, $P_c$ is the the temperature and pressure of a species at its critical point. These two properties often tell us how well or poorly the **ideal gas law** is for describing the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Viral Equation of State\n",
    "\n",
    "The **viral equation of state** is an expression of the quintity $P \\hat{V} / R T $ as a power series in the inverse of specific volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{P \\hat{V}}{R T} = 1 + \\frac{B}{\\hat{V}} + \\frac{B}{\\hat{V}^2} + \\frac{B}{\\hat{V}^3} + ... $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where B, C, and D are the second, third, and fourth virial coefficents respectively. These coefficients are functions of temerature. As of right now, estimating the coefficients beyond B is very difficult so we use a truncated version:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{P \\hat{V}}{R T} = 1 + \\frac{B}{\\hat{V}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the **viral equation of state** we must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. look up the **critical temperature**, $T_c$, the **critical pressure**, $P_c$, and the **Pitzer acentric factor**, $ \\omega $. **Pitzer acentric factor** is a constant that reflects the geometry and polarity of a molecule.\n",
    "2. Calculate the **reduced temperature**, $T_r = T / T_c$.\n",
    "3. Estimate B using: $$ $$ $$ B_0 = 0.083 - \\frac{0.422}{T^{1.6}_r} $$ $$ $$ $$ B_1 = 0.139 - \\frac{0.172}{T^{4.2}_r} $$ $$ $$ $$ B = \\frac{R T_c}{P_c} (B_0 + \\omega B_1) $$ $$ $$\n",
    "4. Substitute B back into the **viral equation of state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Van der Waals  Equation of State\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Van der Waals equation of state** is the first **cubic equations of state**. Cubic equations of state are equations that when expanded are third-order equations for specific volume. The equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\frac{R T}{ \\hat{V} - b} - \\frac{a}{\\hat{V}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = \\frac{27 R^2 T^2_c}{64 P_c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = \\frac{R T_c}{8 P_c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soave–Redlich–Kwong Equation of State\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Soave–Redlich–Kwong** (SRK) equation of state is more complex yet are remarkably robust in describing a variety of systems. The equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\frac{R T}{ \\hat{V} - b} - \\frac{\\alpha a}{\\hat{V} (\\hat{V} + b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = 0.42747 \\frac{(R T_c)^2}{P_C} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = 0 08664 \\frac{R T_c}{P_c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha = (1 + m ( 1 - \\sqrt{T_r}))^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_r = \\frac{T}{T_c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m = 0.48508 + 1.55171 \\omega - 0.1561 \\omega^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compressability Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The **compressibility factor** of a gas is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z = \\frac{ P \\hat{V} }{R T} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "When $ Z = 1 $, the gas behaves ideally. The amount $ Z $ differs from 1 is a measurement of how non-ideal the gas is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method used to estimate $Z$, since every type of gas has diffrent $Z$ factors at the same pressure and tempresure, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look up the **critical temperature**, $T_c$, and **critical pressure**, $P_c$, of the species.\n",
    "2. Calculate the **reduced temperature**, $T_r = \\frac{T}{T_c}$ and **reduced pressure**, $P_r = \\frac{P}{P_c}$.\n",
    "3. Look yp the values of Z on a **generalized compressibility chart**, which plots $Z$ versus $P_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metbhod of estimating $Z$ is the empirical **law of corresponding states**. The reduced temperature and pressure provide a measure of the gas's proximity to its critical state. The closer $T_r$ and $P_r$ are to 1, the closer the gas is to  its critial state. This suggests that a plot of $Z$ verses $T_r$ and $P_r$ will be apporximately the same for all substances. This type of plot, shown below, is called a **generalized compressibility chart**.\n",

    "<img src=\"../figures/Module-4/Compressability_chart.png\" style= \"height:400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line represents a diffrent $T_r$ while $P_r$ is the x-axis. The y value of intersection between the the $T_r$ and $P_r$ is the compressibility factor.\n"
