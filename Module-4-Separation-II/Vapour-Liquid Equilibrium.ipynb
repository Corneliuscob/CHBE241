    "## Introduction\n",
    "Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) occurs under certain circumstances where both a liquid and a vapour of a substance coexist. An example of this is half full jerrycan with gasoline. At the bottom half of the can, there is only liquid gasoline. At the top half, there is gasoline vapour. The vapour and liquid are at equilibrium, meaning that there is as much vapour becoming liquid as liquid becoming vapour."

    "### Raoult's Law and Henry's Law\n",
    "Raoult's Law and Henry's Law provide us with a relationship between the the partial pressure of a substance, $P_A$, in the gas phase and the mole fraction of the same substance, $x_A$, in the liquid phase. Raoult's law is generally valid when $x_A$ is close to 1, which means the liquid is almost pure A. Henry's Law is generaly valid when solutions of $x_A$ are close to 0.\n",
