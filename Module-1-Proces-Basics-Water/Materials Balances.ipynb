    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are certain restrictions imposed by nature that must be considered when designing or analyzing a process. For example, you cannot input 1,000 g of lead and output 2000g of lead or gold. Similarly, if you burn 20 kg of wood, you should know that 20 kg of ash and smoke would be the result of the chemical reaction. The basis of these observations is the law of conservation of mass."

    "### The Law of Conservation of Mass\n",
    "The law of conservation of mass states that mass cannot be destroyed or created. We will not be concerned with the almost infinitesimal conversions between mass and energy associated with chemical reactions. This law means that in chemical reactions, the mass of the products will always be equal to the mas of the reactants. This includes anything from fires to acid-base titrations. Therefore, we can use the general balance equation:\n",

    "Differential balances indicate what is happening in a system at an instant of time and are usually used in a continuous process. Each term of the balance is a rate and has units of the quantity per unit time such as $ \\frac{kg}{s} $.\n",

    "Integral balances describe what is happening in a system between two instants of time and are usually used in a batch process. Each term of the equation is an amount of the quantity such as $kg$."
