    "By the end of this section you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the concept of **latent heat**.\n",
    "2. Differentiate between **heat of melting**, **fusion**, and **vapourization**.\n",
    "3. Understand the concept of **higher heating value** and **lower heating value**.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in **specific enthalpy** of substance that occurs when that substance transitions from one phase to another is known as **latent heat**.\n",

    "### Heat of Vapourization \n",
    "\n",
    "The change in **specific enthalpy** for liquid water to steam at $100 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm is $\\Delta \\hat{H}_v (T,P) = 2,255.6 \\space kJ/kg$. This change **specific enthalpy** in is called the **heat of vapourization**. The condensation of this steam back to liquid water at $100 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm would result in a change **specific enthalpy** of $\\Delta \\hat{H}_v (T,P) = -2,255.6 \\space kJ/kg$.\n",

    "### Heat of Melting and Heat of fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in **specific enthalpy** for liquid water to ice at $0 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm is $\\Delta \\hat{H}_f (T,P) = -333 \\space kJ/kg$. This change **specific enthalpy** in is called the **heat of fusion**. The melting of this ice back to liquid water at $100 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm would result in a change **specific enthalpy** of $\\Delta \\hat{H}_m (T,P) = 333 \\space kJ/kg $. This change **specific enthalpy** in is called the **heat of melting**.\n",

    "### High Heat Value and Low Heat Value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **heating value** of a combustible material is the negative of the standard heat of comubustion. The **higher heating value** is the negative of the standard heat of combustion with liquid water as a product. The **lower heating value** is the negative of the standard heat of combustion with steam as a product. To calculate the **higher heating value** or **lower heating value**, we need the number of moles of water $n$, and we can use the equation.\n",
