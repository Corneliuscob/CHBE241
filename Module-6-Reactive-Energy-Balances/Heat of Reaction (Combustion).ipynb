    "The **heat of reaction**, $\\Delta \\hat{H}_r (T,P) $ is the change in enthalpy for a process in which the quantities of reactants at a temperature and pressure, T and P, react completely in a single reaction to form products.\n",

    "### Exothermic and Endothermic\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example we can use to explain the diffrence between **exothermic** and **endothermic** reactions is the burning of hydrogen gas in oxygen.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2 H_{2} \\small{\\text{(g)}} + O_{2 } \\small{\\text{(g)}} \\longrightarrow 2 H_2 O \\small{\\text{(v)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction is **exothermic**. An **exothermic** reaction occurs when the products of the reaction have a lower internal energy. The net energy released, the **heat of reaction**, in this case would be negative and released as heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the reverse reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2 H_2 O \\small{\\text{(v)}} \\longrightarrow 2 H_{2} \\small{\\text{(g)}} + O_{2 } \\small{\\text{(g)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction will be **endothermic**. An **endothermic** reaction occurs when the products of the reaction have a higher internal energy. The net energy released, the **heat of reaction**, in this case would be positive will need heat for the reaction to occur.\n",
