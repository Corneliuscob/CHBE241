    "There are two common methods to solving energy balances. The first is **heat of reaction method**. This method is generally prefered for a single reaction sys where $ \\Delta H_r$ is known. The second method is **heat of formation method**. This method is generally prefered for multiple reactions and systems where $ \\Delta H_r$ is not readily available.\n",

    "There are seven steps to solving an energy balance using the **heat of reaction method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve the material balances as much as possible.\n",
    "2. Choose reference states for energy calculations.\n",
    "3. Calculate the extent of reaction for all reactions.\n",
    "4. Prepare the inlet/outlet enthalpy table.\n",
    "5. Calculate Enthalpies.\n",
    "6. Calculate $ \\Delta \\dot{H}$ for the reactor.\n",
    "7. Solve the energy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try using this method to solve an energy balance. Suppose you are trying to solve this energy balance:\n",
