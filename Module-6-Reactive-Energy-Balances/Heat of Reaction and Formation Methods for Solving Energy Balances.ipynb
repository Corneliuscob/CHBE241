    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common methods to solving energy balances. The first is **heat of reaction method**. This method is generally prefered for a single reaction sys where $ \\Delta H_r$ is known. The second method is **heat of formation method**. This method is generally prefered for multiple reactions and systems where $ \\Delta H_r$ is not readily available.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are seven steps to solving an energy balance using the **heat of reaction method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve the material balances as much as possible.\n",
    "2. Choose reference states for energy calculations.\n",
    "3. Calculate the extent of reaction for all reactions.\n",
    "4. Prepare the inlet/outlet enthalpy table.\n",
    "5. Calculate Enthalpies.\n",
    "6. Calculate $ \\Delta \\dot{H}$ for the reactor.\n",
    "7. Solve the energy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try using this method to solve an energy balance. Suppose you are trying to solve this energy balance:\n",

    "#### 1. Solve the material balances as much as possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this problem, the material balance has already been solved\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Choose reference states for energy calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   For the reacting species, $C_3 H_8 \\small{\\text{(g)}}$, $ O_2 \\small{\\text{(g)}}$, $C O_2 \\small{\\text{(g)}}$, $H_2 O \\small{\\text{(l)}}$, we will choose $25 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm as our reference state so that we have the same reference as the heat of reaction.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For the non-reacting species, $N_2 \\small{\\text{(g)}}$, we will choose $25 ^{\\circ} C$ and $1$ atm as our reference state because we have an enthalpy table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3. Calculate the extent of reaction for all reactions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   In this case we have 1 reaction and can use the formula (for any compound involved in the reaction):\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$ \\xi = \\frac{\\mid (\\dot{n}_i)_{out} - (\\dot{n}_i)_{in} \\mid}{\\mid \\dot{\\nu}_i \\mid} $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$ \\xi = \\frac{\\mid (\\dot{n}_{C O_2})_{out} - (\\dot{n}_{C O_2})_{in} \\mid}{\\mid \\dot{\\nu}_{C O_2} \\mid}  = \\frac{\\mid 300 - 0 \\mid}{\\mid 3 \\mid} = 100$$\n",
