    "### Steps to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the input stream does not have a flow rate listed in the question or the diagram, assume a mass or volumteric flow rate of a random number, preferrably a mass flow rate with a nice round number like 100 $kg/h$. \n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "2. Draw and label the flow chart based on the question. **Note:** The masses from the fresh feed are conserved and mixed with the recycle stream, giving different fractional compositions. We will **not** be considering chemical reactions between constrituents of the fresh feed and reactor feed.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "3. Write expressions for the quantities requested in the problem statement. (e.g. $m_3$ = $m_{B3}$ + $m_{T3}$, $x_B$ = $m_{B3}/m_3$). The expressions should be written to help in solving for the missing parameters of the process.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "4. Convert all mixed units to one uniform units (**elaborate**). In most cases, it would be converting all the units to masses. A few methods to remember to use are:\n",
    "    1. Molecular weights.\n",
    "    2. Molecular fractions.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "5. Perform a degree-of-freedom analysis on the process to determine if it is solvable. \n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "6. **Do the algebra.** "
