    "1. A volumetric flow rate is given for the feed stream, but mass flow rates and fractions will\n",

    "from the known volumetric flow rate and density of the feed stream.\n",

    "3. We could have labeled the mass flow rate and mass fractions of the bottom stream as we did\n",
    "the overhead. However, since we have no information about either the flow rate or composition\n",
    "of this stream, we have instead labeled the component flow rates (following the rule\n",
    "of thumb given in Step 2 of the general procedure).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Every component mass flow rate in every process stream can be expressed in terms of labeled\n",
