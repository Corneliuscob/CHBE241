    "To account for __open__ systems. Enthalpy is used as  a __measurement of Energy__ in a system. This This notebook will go over a short explanation of enthalpy and go over prblem 7.4-2 of the textbook.\n",

    "Recall that The energy equation in a closed system is $E_{tot} = Q - W  $ and after negating potential and kinetic energy becomes: $U = Q-W$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an open sytem there is a transfer of material. This means that there needs to be a correction for internal energy $U $ to account for the particles leaving the system. Enthalpy $H$  is a measure of energy accounts for open systems and the Energy balance becomes: $$H = Q-W$$ and $$ \\Delta H =  \\Delta Q- \\Delta W $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Enthalpy is extremely useful because many processes in checmial engineering are open systems and as a result, there are extensive databases that contain entahlpy values of various chemicals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Enthalpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Enthalpy is defined as $H= U+pV$ and a change of enthalpy is defined as $\\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta pV$. This account for the open system by noticing that the pressure of the system remaisn constant with the pressure of hte surroundings.\n"
