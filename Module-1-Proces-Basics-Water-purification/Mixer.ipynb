    "## Introduction\n",
    "In a process, a mixer is a unit operation that attempts to make a **heterogeneous** system into a **homogenous** system. Examples include scrambling eggs, mixing sugar and cream into coffee, and a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor used in water treatment. A mixer allows heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams. \n",

    "\n",
    "* **Liquid-Liquid Mixing**\n",
    "    * Liquid-Liquid mixing is one of the most common forms of mixing in a process. As the name suggest this is the process of mixing one liquid with another. An example is the cream in your coffee\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Gas-Gas Mixing**\n",
    "    * Gas-Gas mixing, also called gas blending, is the process of mixing gases. An example is in scuba diving tanks. To prevent the bends, non-air breathing gases are added to dilute the oxygen.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Solid-Solid Mixing**\n",
    "    * Solid-Solid mixing is one of the oldest unit operations in the process industry and involves the mixing of a solid with another solid. An example is in pharmaceuticals industry where powders are mixed together to dilute a drug.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Liquid-Solid Mixing**\n",
    "    * Liquid-Solid mixing is the act of mixing a solid and a liquid. An example of this would be mixing sugar into your coffee.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Liquid-Gas Mixing**\n",
    "    * Liquid-Gas mixing is the act of mixing a Gas and a liquid. An example of this would be mixing $ C O_2 $ in soda to carbonate the liquid.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Gas-Solid Mixing**\n",
    "    * Gas-Solid mixing is the act of mixing a Gas and a Solid. This process is not very common. An example is sifting flour.\n",

The first being magnetic stirrers where a magnet is inserted into your solution and the solution is placed on an apparatus and is left to mix. The second being a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor for water pollution treatment.\n",
