    "### Feedstock\n",
    "Feedstock is raw material used to supply an industrial process. The cost of the feedstock is determined by its **quantity** and **quality**. The higher the quality, which is defined by its purity, the higher the price. Though high purity feedstock is more expensive, the presence of impurities creates more **unwanted by-products** and waste products from the reaction. Impurities can also reduce the effectiveness of catalyst and increase corrosion so there is a middle ground that needs to be found. A good analogy of this is the productivity of a person vs how many hours a week they have worked. ![](../figures/Module-1/Graph.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, in the figure above, more hours worked in a week does not always relate to more productivity. This is also true with purity and profits. There is a certain point where high purity yields less profits."

    "### Catalyst\n",
    "Catalyst greatly increase the efficiency of a process, lower operating costs and increase profits. Every catalyst works differently but the main idea behind it is that they lower the activation energy needed to allow a chemical reaction to occur. By lower the activation energy, the energy needed to produce the wanted products is greatly lowered. ![](../figures/Module-1/Graph-2.png)"

    "### Energy\n",
    "One of the largest if not the largest cost of a chemical process is the energy cost. The energy needed can be lowered by using a catalyst, discovering new ways to improve how a reaction is conducted, or renewing old unit operations. Decreasing the energy needed for the process increases profits and helps the environment by lowering the carbon footprint of the process."
